## Over all  use case:

A typical use case where in a user calls into the customer service for specific issues that he/she is facing needs a help by transcribing the call/ generating the sentiment using AWS bedrock. Send out alerts for any escalations ( Event driven using Lambda): To address this use case in a 
traditional work flow we might need lot of code base / infra / setup.  Using AWS bedrock we could able to relatively automate this use case.
